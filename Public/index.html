						<h2>Thoughts</h2>
						<div>
							<p>
								I have once again started playing chess. When I
								was younger, I played chess a lot, but as I got
								older, I was unable to find friends that wanted
								to sit down over the board and play. I recently
								created an account on chess.com to see if I
								still knew what I was doing. I am learning the
								blitz format, but I must say I am not the
								greatest at that. My favorite part of chess is
								studying the board for a little bit before each
								move. I like to understand the move before doing
								it, and also, I look to see if I can understand
								what my opponent is doing. When playing blitz, I
								often get behind in time, then blunder away a
								piece to make things more difficult. I have some
								goals that I have set for this chess hobby. I
								don't plan on becoming a grandmaster or
								anything, but I want to get to a point where I
								feel comfortable playing against people in the
								1500 - 1800 rating area.
